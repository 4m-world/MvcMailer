		MvcMailer sends emails using the MVC views as Email Body with no effort. See an example at the project site.
		This is email done eight for ASP.Net MVC - no more spaghetti code for emailing :) See the code project article
		at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/MvcMailerNuGet.aspx to learn more about MvcMailer!

		MvcMailer has a MailerBase class that extends ControllerBase class. So, Mailers are just like your Controllers.
		As a result, you can use all the controller goodies without any learning curve, period. The end result
		is a professional looking HTML email body ready for your to send to your website users.

		Here's a quick list of features:
		a) Use Razor/WebForms views
		b) Use Master pages
		c) Write Testable Code
		d) Pass values to your view using ViewBag or ViewModel and
		e) Generate Absolute URL using Url.Abs method [New in V0.5].

		This package has a very good amount of test coverage and if you want, take a look at the project site.
